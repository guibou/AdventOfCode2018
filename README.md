My advent of code for 2018

Each days are in `src/DayN.hs`.

`src/DayX.hs` is the template to start each day, just replace the name "DayX" by "DayN".

Starts stack with `nix-shell --run 'cabal new-repl'` to start a session and `:l YourDay'.

`Utils` contains a shitload of utils ;)

The cabal file is full of enabled extensions, I hope I'll win some seconds with them.
